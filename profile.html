          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Kevin (limekin as alias), a self-taught Ruby main programmer. I write, read and code things. I also play multiplayer online
            games. I do a little bit of designs.
          </p>
          <h3>About blog</h3>
          <p>
            This blog is mainly composed of the things like my personal utilities, way of doing things, shares about the
            things I learn or discover. These will be focused mostly around web development. And if you ask me whether
            the content in here matter to you or not, I can say maybe. Maybe the utilities I use can help you, maybe my
            way of doing things can help you. More precisely, I should really say instead, it's upto you to decide.
            <img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/4fvfcja.gif" border="0" >
          </p>
          <p>
            As a side note, this blog doesn't represent me professionally or formally as a programmer. Instead this is
            completely an informal blog I would like to maintain for fun (and as a hobby ?).
          </p>
          <h3>Blog decomplied</h3>
          <p>
            Now, all the technical and design elements I have used in this site are free to use. But really they are
            a set of quality elements which made bringin up this blog easy. And not to mention, it really takes a
            good deal of work to create these stuffs even though its free. So I'm decompiling and crediting
            eveything I have used in this site.
          </p>
          <h4>Fonts</h4>
          <p>
            The blog uses 'Roboto Condensed' and 'Open Sans' from
            <a href='https://www.google.com/fonts' target='_blank'>Google Fonts.</a>
            You can search the font names in there, the authors are also specified.

          </p>
          <h4>Smileys you see here and there</h4>
